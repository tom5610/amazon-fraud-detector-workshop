# Amazon Fraud Detector Workshop Lab
---

The repository is based https://github.com/mikames/data-and-notebooks and I've added the model training and merge prediction with Mike's prediction notebook. I hope that you enjoy the learning.

## Steps

* Spin up environments with [fraud-detector-workshop.yaml](./fraud-detector-workshop.yaml), which creates:
  * Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance
  * IAM roles for Notebook instance and Amazon Fraud Detector data access
* Open Jupyter notebook from SageMaker Notebook instance and start experiencing model training and prediction with Fraud Detector.

## Notes
This repository contains sample notebooks and data, feel free to use as you like.
